# Click-n-Brick
A Property Marketplace App Design project

*Utilising the power of students*

## OVERVIEW

The **Click’n’Brick** Property Marketplace App is a platform designed to make buying property online the go-to choice for any and all prospective buyers within the UK.

Our primary goal was to produce a high-fidelity, working mobile app prototype on Figma. This was in response to the client’s brief and subsequent discussions with them.

The client’s brief had 3 key deliverables: 
- Produce a high-fidelity, working prototype app on Figma
- Design a seamless mobile app user experience for somebody looking to buy a property in the UK
- Produce a UI Design System, including three logo options.

### Problem statement

“How could we design a property marketplace app prototype that could compete in an already competitive market?”

### Users & Audience 

The user of the product is prospective property buyers in the UK.

To help us develop the accessibility and inclusivity of the app, we considered a number of user personas, each with unique requirements. 

This enabled us to account for a wide range of demographics, and how we could accommodate them when designing the app.

### Team Roles & Responsibilities 

Team size: 7
Tools: Slack, Google meets, Miro, Trello, Figma

With experience in leadership, I became team lead and managed the project - keeping it on track throughout.

The whole team worked together to research, understand and define the problem.

Accounting for skillsets & time restraints, to ideate and prototype we decided to branch off into 2 teams - Functionality (UX) and design (UI).

Daily standups and retros enabled our teams to remain close-knit and work towards the same goal throughout.

The Functionality team: looked at the user journey,  wireframing, layout, application architecture and prototyping.

The Design team focused on the UI design phases - looking at Colour Schemes, Typography, Icons and Logos.

### Scope & Constraints

Being a course project, there were a few constraints:

* **Budget**: there was no set budget for this project
* **A fictitious project brief**: we had to make light of this and produce a project in the most realistic way possible
* **Time**: We had a total of 8 weeks to finish and present the project
* **Skillset**: As students, we all came from different backgrounds, but had a wide range of skillsets to offer.
* **Working remotely**: We worked remotely and adapted quickly. 


## RESEARCH & EMPATHISE

### Market Research: Overview

With the brief analysed, it was time to gain a better understanding of the product and its users. To achieve this, we performed a series of primary and secondary research methods.

### Primary Research

#### Online Survey

We prepared an online survey with a total of 36 respondents to determine the interest in using an online property marketplace to buy properties and understand what features make them desirable.

#### Focus Group

We also carried out a focus group with 5 participants for an open-ended opinion of current property marketplace apps and their viability for buying property and booking viewings.

### Secondary Research

#### Competitor analysis 

We analysed our competitors to get an insight into the service and features they offered. 
Firstly, we downloaded and browsed the competitor apps. Next, we took screenshots of their golden path along with any relevant features and pasted them onto miro. Then, we reviewed each competitor as a team, making notes of their product’s Pros & Cons.

‘Experiencing what the market leaders offered inspired many of our functionality and design decisions later on.‘

Some key competitors include: Right Move, Zoopla, Purple Bricks, On the Market, Prime Location & Redfin.

#### Market Reports

As the property marketplace is already very well researched, we were able to take advantage of previously carried out market reports. We found excellent insights from the ‘2020 Home Buyers Generational Trends Report’.


* 94% of homebuyers were aged between 22 - 73. 
* 93% frequently used the internet to search for homes. 
* Despite this, buyers wanted support from agents during the buying process. 
* **Trustworthiness** and **Honesty** were the two most important factors when choosing an agent to work with.


### Key Research Findings

Through the Primary and secondary research it was clear that users looking to buy a property online wanted:

* Honest, reliable and trustworthy agents.
* Fully comprehensive & transparent property information and visuals 
* To view the property in person before buying
* To handle finances with the agent in person

Our findings made it clear that we should develop an app that provides prospective property buyers with an easy-to-use, comprehensive and trustworthy property search experience and bridge the gap between the agent and buyer.

### User Personas 

Based on the findings from the research, we created 3 personas that represented our user base. We referred to them throughout the product design process to account for inclusivity.

### User Journey Maps
To understand how our user would interact with the service, we created a User Journey Map. Below is the User Journey Map for …

### User Research Presentation
We then presented our Research to the course leader. This marked the end of our research phase.
