_A Property Marketplace App Design project_

![Cover Image](/images/CoverImage.png)

## OVERVIEW

The **Click’n’Brick** Property Marketplace App is a platform designed to make buying property online the go-to choice for any and all prospective buyers within the UK.

### Project Brief

The client’s brief had 3 key deliverables:

- Produce a high-fidelity, working prototype app on Figma.
- Design a seamless mobile app user experience for somebody looking to buy a property in the UK.
- Produce a UI Design System, including three logo options.

### Problem statement

_“How could we design a property marketplace app prototype that could compete in an already competitive market?”_

### Project management

* **Team size**: 7
* **Tools**: Slack, Google meets, Miro, Trello, Figma, Pen & Paper
* **Decision making**: Dot voting
* **communication**: Daily stand-ups & retros, slack, google meets, trello

### The Team Roles

With experience in leadership, I became team lead and managed the project - keeping it on track throughout.

The whole team worked together to research, empathise and define the problem.

Accounting for skillsets & time restraints, to ideate and prototype we decided to branch off into 2 teams - Functionality (UX) and design (UI).

* **The Functionality team**: looked at the user journey, wireframing, layout, application architecture and prototyping.
* **The Design team**: focused on the UI design phases - looking at Colour Schemes, Typography, Icons and Logos.

### Scope & Constraints

Being a course project, there were a few constraints:

- **Budget**: there was no set budget for this project.
- **A fictitious project brief**: we had to make light of this and produce a project in the most realistic way possible.
- **Time**: We had a total of 8 weeks to finish and present the project.
- **Skillset**: As students, we all came from different backgrounds, but had a wide range of skillsets to offer.
- **Working remotely**: We worked remotely and adapted quickly.

## RESEARCH & EMPATHISE

### Market Research: Overview

With the brief analysed, it was time to gain a better understanding of the product and its users. To achieve this, we carried out primary and secondary research.

### Primary Research

#### Online Survey

We prepared an online survey with a total of 36 respondents to determine the interest in using an online property marketplace to buy properties and understand what features make them desirable.

#### Focus Group

We also carried out a focus group with 5 participants for an open-ended opinion of current property marketplace apps and their viability for buying property and booking viewings.

### Secondary Research

#### Competitor analysis

We analysed our competitors to get an insight into the service and features they offered.
Firstly, we downloaded and browsed the competitor apps. Next, we took screenshots of their golden path along with any relevant features and pasted them onto miro. Then, we reviewed each competitor as a team, making notes of their product’s Pros & Cons.

_‘Experiencing what the market leaders offered inspired many of our functionality and design decisions later on.‘_

Some key competitors include: Right Move, Zoopla, Purple Bricks, On the Market, Prime Location & Redfin.

#### Market Reports

As the property marketplace is already very well researched, we were able to take advantage of previously carried out market reports. We found excellent insights from the ‘2020 Home Buyers Generational Trends Report’.

- 94% of homebuyers were aged between 22 - 73.
- 93% frequently used the internet to search for homes.
- Despite this, buyers wanted support from agents during the buying process.
- **Trustworthiness** and **Honesty** were the two most important factors when choosing an agent to work with.

### Key Research Findings

Through the Primary and secondary research it was clear that users looking to buy a property online wanted:

- Honest, reliable and trustworthy agents.
- Fully comprehensive & transparent property information and visuals
- To view the property in person before buying
- To handle finances with the agent in person

Our findings made it clear that we should develop an app that provides prospective property buyers with an easy-to-use, comprehensive and trustworthy property search experience and bridge the gap between the agent and buyer.


### User Personas

Based on the findings from the research, we created user personas that represented our user base. We referred to them throughout the product design process to account for accessibility & inclusivity.

This enabled us to account for a wide range of demographics, and consider how we could accommodate them when designing the app.

### User Journey Maps

To understand how our user would interact with the service, we created a User Journey Map. 

### User Research Presentation

We then presented our Research to the course leader. This marked the end of our research phase.

## IDEATION, PROTORYPING & TESTING

### Design Sprint 1

For sprint 1, we branched off into 2 teams; Functionality & Design. Given our 8-week project limit, we decided it would be the most time effective to address both areas simultaneously.

## Sprint 1 - Functionality (UX)

**Sprint Goal**: Design and test a Lo-Fi Prototype of the app

### Our Process:

#### How Might We

Using the problems uncovered from research findings, we constructed ‘How Might We’ questions to frame the problems for ideation.

HMW - create a unique funtionality, yet be simple to use at the same time?

#### Define the golden path

Having already developed user journey maps during the competitor analysis, we used them for inspiration when developing our golden path. Our objective was to design a golden path that enabled the user to enter, search, filter, view and contact the agent in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

#### Information Architecture

Now that the golden path was defined, we had a group brainstorm on miro to help develop the secondary user pathways. Putting our ideas together, we developed a high-level version of our app’s Information Architecture. This provided a visual aid for how each screen interacts with one another.

#### Crazy 8’s

Firstly, we reviewed the competitor user journeys for pre-exercise inspiration. Then, for each step of the golden path, we did a crazy 8’s sketching exercise to get ideas flowing for the layout of each screen.

#### Lo-fi Wireframe (sketch)

Using the Crazy 8 sketches as inspiration, we combined our favourite elements and sketched a more polished wireframe version for each stage of the user journey. As we were doing well for time, we also sketched out the secondary pathway screens.

#### Lo-fi Wireframe (Digital)

Next, we digitalised the sketched wireframes using Figma. This gave us something more presentable for user testing.

#### User Testing

Now our lo-fi prototype was ready for testing. We carried out 2 separate usability tests simultaneously. We asked a series of guided questions and noted the feedback. Using the feedback gathered, we could continue to develop our project in the following sprint.
FEEDBACK & QUESTION IMAGE

### Reviewing the feedback of sprint #1

The usability testing feedback from sprint #1 gave us plenty of fuel for our backlog. We divided the tasks between the team and worked through them systematically.

3 key user-centric iterations to the golden path included:

- Adding the filters screen to the golden path, rather than a secondary screen.
  - Some users felt confused with performing a search without the option of applying filters
- Adding a third call to action on the property information page ‘book a viewing.
  - Users expressed they would like to arrange a booking without needing to contact the agent first.
- Improving the header & footer navigation bar design and functionality (IMAGE)
  - Menu options on the footer = 1 click instead of 2, a better position for natural thumb use.

## Sprint 1 - Design (UI)

**Sprint Goal** - Produce UI design scheme

### Our Process

#### How Might We

We used our primary and secondary research to formulate some ‘how might we’ questions regarding the design which would guide us through this design sprint.

#### Colour Selection

Using other app and sites as inspiration, we brainstormed possible colour choices and researched colour psychology within design.

We chose the colour green to base our colour palette around because of its connotations of a fresh start, life, cleanliness and the ecosystem. We used lime green as our accent colour to guide the user from the start to the end of the golden path and grey, green and black/green as our primary and secondary colour blends.

#### Logo Selection

For the logo, we wanted something clean and fresh to attract the attention of the user, whilst also denoting safety and trust.

Logo development started with the idea to merge images that represented both ‘click’ & ‘brick’.
After creating several logo ideas each, we received feedback from the functionality team and then decided on the following logo design.

#### Typography

For our font, we chose Lato as research showed it as friendly and easy to read. These values align very well with the app we are designing.

#### Icon Kit

We developed our own icon kit from various available online icon packs. We edited the icons where needed to make them consistent in design.

#### Buttons

We designed a range of buttons with varying functions and hierarchies.

#### Dark mode

With accessibility being an important design consideration, we designed a dark mode colour scheme and functionality. We chose desaturated colours which meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

#### UI Design Kit

And here is the final UI kit. IMAGE

## Sprint 2 -

**\_Collaborate as one team, combine work, and produce a hi-fi prototype.**\_

**Sprint Goal**: Design a hi-fi working prototype on Figma

### Our Process:

#### Apply feedback-related changes

The feedback from user testing of sprint 1 provided us with a backlog of agreed design and functionality changes to work through.

With the golden path the priority, changes were applied to these wireframe screens first. Once complete, we worked through the secondary pathway screen changes.

#### Apply the UI scheme to the lo-fi wireframes

The design team then applied the UI scheme to the Figma wireframe following the same order: 1. Golden path, 2. Secondary Pathways

#### Make a working prototype on Figma

Meanwhile, the functionality team worked on making the wireframes an interactive prototype on figma.

#### Consistency checks

Once the prototype was working, we worked as a team to test:

- Design and layout consistency between all wireframe screens.
- All user flows were working as intended.

#### Usability Testing

With our working prototype ready, we prepared and carried out a Usability Test on 6 individual participants. They performed a series of tasks while we took notes.

This helped us understand how the user interacted with the app and gain feedback for future iterations.

**Some key findings include**:

- Less prominent delete account button
- Accessibility options should be reachable on the landing page
- Use of language - e.g. Change ‘browse’ to ‘search’ - a more deliberate action
  *Tweaks to button layout and hierarchy
  *Interactive map (default & Satellite view icon to be clearer)

#### Apply feedback-related changes

With the project nearing its end, we applied the changes that time permitted. Any remaining changes would be made in possible future iterations.

## Conclusion

### Project Outcomes

We had successfully achieved our project goal within the 8-week timeframe - produce a high-fidelity prototype, whilst meeting the needs of the client.

This was made possible by our teamwork, organisation and adaptability throughout the project. We embraced the user-centric approach and based our design decisions on user research and feedback.

On an individual level, I am pleased with my lead role in the team. My planning, organisation and leadership gave the team direction and unity, whilst ensuring we achieved our project goal within the timeframe.

### Lessons learned

Some key lessons I’ve learned are:
*Design decisions should be based on what the user needs NOT what the designer likes.
*Teamwork is the key to success - Each team member brings something valuable to the table. Find out what and utilise it.
\*User testing offers incredibly useful feedback for further iterations.

### Final words

Thank you for taking the time to view this case study.

Being my first design project, there are undoubtedly areas of the process which can be improved. However, I started this project at ground zero and finished it with a sound understanding of the design thinking process with skills and experience to match.

I’m looking forward to future opportunities where I can apply what I now know while continuing to learn and develop.
