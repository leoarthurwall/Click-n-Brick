# Click-n-Brick
A Property Marketplace App Design project
*Utilising the power of students*

## OVERVIEW

The **Click’n’Brick** Property Marketplace App is a platform designed to make buying property online the go-to choice for any and all prospective buyers within the UK.

Our primary goal was to produce a high-fidelity, working mobile app prototype on Figma. This was in response to the client’s brief and subsequent discussions with them.

The client’s brief had 3 key deliverables: 
- Produce a high-fidelity, working prototype app on Figma
- Design a seamless mobile app user experience for somebody looking to buy a property in the UK
- Produce a UI Design System, including three logo options.

### Problem statement

“How could we design a property marketplace app prototype that could compete in an already competitive market?”

### Users & Audience 

The user of the product is prospective property buyers in the UK.

To help us develop the accessibility and inclusivity of the app, we considered a number of user personas, each with unique requirements. 

This enabled us to account for a wide range of demographics, and how we could accommodate them when designing the app.

### Roles & Responsibilities 

Team size: 7
Tools: Slack, Google meets, Miro, Trello, Figma

With experience in leadership, I became team lead and managed the project - keeping it on track throughout.

The whole team worked together to research, understand and define the problem.

Accounting for skillsets & time restraints, to ideate and prototype we decided to branch off into 2 teams - Functionality (UX) and design (UI).

Daily standups and retros enabled our teams to remain close-knit and work towards the same goal throughout.

The Functionality team: looked at the user journey,  wireframing, layout, application architecture and prototyping.

The Design team focused on the UI design phases - looking at Colour Schemes, Typography, Icons and Logos.

### Scope & Constraints

Being a course project, there were a few constraints:

* Budget: there was no set budget for this project
* A fictitious project brief: we had to make light of this and produce a project in the most realistic way possible
* Time: We had a total of 8 weeks to finish and present the project
* Skillset: As students, we all came from different backgrounds, but had a wide range of skillsets to offer.
* Working remotely: We worked remotely and adapted quickly.
